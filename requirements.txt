# onnxruntime-tools implicitly installed with onnxruntime, or specify if particular version needed
# For onnxruntime.quantization.quantize_static, onnxruntime-tools is not strictly listed as a separate pip install usually.
# It's part of the onnxruntime package, specifically the contrib modules.
# However, if direct utilities from onnxruntime-tools are needed as a separate package, it should be listed.
# For now, assuming onnxruntime covers the quantization utilities.

# coin_clip fork - this will be a local/git dependency, not from PyPI directly
# For a typical requirements.txt, you might point to a git repo:
# coin-clip @ git+https://github.com/user/coin-clip-fork.git@main
# For now, I will assume it's importable in the environment.
